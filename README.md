Milestone 2 Project for NC Digital Skills Bootcamp

## Deployment

The web site is deployed at __________________ (YOUR DEPLOYED GITHUB.IO URL).


## Logic

This application is a user-friendly music application that allows users to access a interface that can be used locally in North Carolina.   
The users can pick and search other users music and compare their music taste.   
The user can pick from cities like: Fayetteville, Charlotte, Raleigh and many others. Once the user looks up another user it will show their most played song, artists and genre.  
```

### Post-MVP Plans
Post plans we have for this application is to expand the user search to not only cities but the top songs in the area, For Example for Fayetteville it will be the 910.
Another thing that we will improve on is the design interface to the user make it more creative and easier for other users.
